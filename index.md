Hi everyone my major is Biology with a minor in GIS and I'm a senior at MSU!
I am super passionate about advocating for my Indigenous peeoples worldwide and want to get a Ph.D in Indigenous Tradtional Ecological Knowledge.
Below is picture where I was helping set up a Tipi for our first ever Tri_institutional Pow Wow for our 2022 spring graduates for CCD, CU, and MSU!

This year as an intern I am excited to solidify my coding skills by teaching or helping others work through their obstacles. I know I am not in charge of the project ideas this year but I hope to see students applying multiple forms of Earth Data into their projects so it can be as applicable as possible!
